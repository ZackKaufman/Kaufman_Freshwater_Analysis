The repository contains Python notebooks to produce Figures 1-3 using the source data provided as .nc files. Most  model and reanalysis output has been pre-processed on Sherlock, Stanford’s high-performance computing cluster, and provided here as smaller files requiring minimal compute resources. 

## Installation 
Package dependencies, if needed, can be installed directly from within the Python notebooks. Accordingly, users may wish to create a separate environment for running the notebooks, so that their pre-existing local configurations are unaffected.
