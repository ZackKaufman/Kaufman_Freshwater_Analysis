This code will be in active development throughout the review process. If accepted, the latest version will be archived on Zenodo with a minted DOI. 

The repository contains Python notebooks to produce Figures 1-3 using the source data provided as .nc files. With the exception of the faf-water and antwater forcing fields, all model and reanalysis output has been pre-processed on Sherlock, Stanford’s high-performance computing cluster, and provided here as smaller files requiring minimal compute resources. 

## Installation 
Package dependencies, if needed, can be installed directly from within the Python notebooks. Accordingly, users may wish to create a separate environment for running the notebooks, so that their pre-existing local configurations are unaffected.
